### Overview of the project

The application is a treassure hunt/quiz application. It has 6 rounds and it each round contains one clue to start the hunt. Additionally each round contains 3 hints in order to help the user to find the answer. Using each clue deducts a certain amount of points so the user needs to use the minimum number of clues.
Each incorrect answer leads to a deduction of -1 mark. If a user answers a single question incorrectly for 5 times all his progress would be lost and he would have to start again. At the end of 6 rounds a results page is shown showing one's overall performance. The leaderboard page shows the performance of all the different users who have played the game.
